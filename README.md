# Obsidisan Excalidraw Diagrams

This repo contains diagrams created in excalidraw and managed inside the [Obisdian app](https://obsidian.md/)

This is just an experiment but I think Obisidan can be a good tool to manage these diagrams because:
- it provides a system to organize and centralize them
- it provides a system to keep track of their changes (Git)
- it provides a tag system for the diagrams and enhanced search
- It integrates nicely with Obsidian features that are very helpful for learning, writing and thinking

## Requirements

To be able to fully manage these diagrams you'll need:
- the [Obisdian app](https://obsidian.md/)
- the [obsidian-excalidraw-plugin](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin)

Once installed and activated the [obsidian-excalidraw-plugin](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin) it will create all the excalidraw diagrams by default in the  `Plugins options > Excalidraw > Excalidraw folder`
