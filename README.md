# Obsidisan Excalidraw Diagrams

This repo contains diagrams created in excalidraw and managed inside the [Obisdian app](https://obsidian.md/)

This is just an experiment but I think Obisidan can be a good tool to manage these diagrams because:
- it provides a system to organize and centralize them
- it provides a system to keep track of their changes (Git)
- it provides a tag system for the diagrams and enhanced search
- It integrates nicely with Obsidian features that are very helpful for learning, writing and thinking

## Requirements

To be able to fully manage these diagrams you'll need:
- the [Obisdian app](https://obsidian.md/)
- the [obsidian-excalidraw-plugin](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin) to manage excalidraw diagrams inside Obsidian

Once installed and activated the [obsidian-excalidraw-plugin](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin) it will create all the excalidraw diagrams by default in the  `Plugins options > Excalidraw > Excalidraw folder`

## How to use diagrams in this repo

You can clone this folder inside your Obsidian vault's folder to get access to these diagrams inside the app

From Obsidian you will be able to edit diagrams and add new ones

From the folder's path (terminal) you can pull and push to sync your files with the remote repo

Diagrams can be found inside Obsidian by searching by:
- tags defined each diagram
- texts inside diagrams
- words inside filenames

In the repo you'll find two types of files: 
- `*.md` or `*.excalidraw.md` → these are the excalidraw diagrams managed by the [`obsidian-excalidraw-plugin`](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin)inside Obsidian (they can be opened and edited inside Obsidian when the plugin is installed and activated)
- `*.png` → these are the images generated automatically by the `Autoexport to PNG` setting of the  plugin `obsidian-excalidraw-plugin`
